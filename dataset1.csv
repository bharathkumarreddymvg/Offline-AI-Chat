Write a Python code for binary search.

A binary search is an algorithm that searches for specific keys in a sorted database with time complexity of O(log n). It performs binary searches on all the elements by splitting the array into two parts, one containing the target key and the other being empty. The following is an example of Python code for binary search:
```
def BinarySearch(arr, x):  # Function to perform Binary Search  
    low = 0; high = len(arr) - 1  
    while (low <= high):  
        mid = (high + low) / 2; if arr[mid] == x:  
            return mid  
        elif arr[mid] > x:  
            high = mid - 1  
        else:  
            low = mid + 1  
    return -1  
```
arr: an input array. 
x: the item to be found in the array
Returns the index of the target key if present, and -1 otherwise.",2025-10-21 10:36:07.077095
